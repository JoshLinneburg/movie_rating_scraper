# Movie Review Scraping Notebook

We want to scrape the following data about a movie a given user has rated on the movie rating website letterboxd.com:
* Movie title
* Movie URL
* Description
* Genre
* A user's rating
* Distribution of community ratings
* Community average rating
* Crew
* Cast
* Other attributes?

Our goal is to visualize a user's movie preferences and predict what a user will rate a movie based on the dimensions scraped.
